				  <p style="color: #2c041c; font-size: large; line-height: 200%;">Amy Hope Hinaman attended Sampson Elementary and Spillane Middle School, and she was a junior at Cypress Woods High School. Amy was a proud member of the Wildcat marching and symphonic bands. She loved music and played the clarinet and bassoon. Amy loved her band friends with her whole heart, and the band hall was her home away from home. She also loved Broadway musicals, coffee, and mint chocolate chip ice cream. Amy served the community through her involvement in National Charity League, as she volunteered often with her mom and sister, and was a member of the National Honor Society. Her family loved traveling together and cherishes the memories they made on their many trips to Seaside, Asheville, and Disney World. 
 
					Amy was such a funny, intelligent, and compassionate girl. She was a proud member of the LGBTQ community and used her voice to stand up for herself and others. She was exceptionally kind and never hesitated to reach out to others who may have been feeling left out. She truly cared about making those around her feel loved, appreciated, and valued. 
					
					Amy will be greatly missed by everyone who knew her. Her family loves her deeply, fiercely, and forever. They are grateful for the outpouring of love and support from their community. It was a privilege to have Amy in our lives and she will always be loved. May she find peace, and may we all hold her in our hearts always.
